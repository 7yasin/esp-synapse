# üß† Project Synapse

> A distributed, privacy‚Äëfocused cyber security platform built on low‚Äëcost **ESP‚Äëbased** devices. Each node operates as a headless *Agent*, remotely controlled by a mobile *Commander App*. Together, they form a flexible and cooperative system for wireless network analysis and privacy defense ‚Äî fully interoperable across both **ESP8266** and **ESP32** hardware.

## üöÄ Overview

Project Synapse introduces a scalable architecture where multiple low‚Äëcost microcontroller boards work together to analyze, test, and protect wireless networks in a controlled and ethical manner.

* **Commander:** A mobile control application managing all Agents remotely.
* **Agents:** Headless devices (ESP8266 / ESP32) that execute assigned network operations autonomously.
* **Control Network:** A secure Wi‚ÄëFi network established by the Commander to coordinate communications.

Agents connect, receive REST‚Äëbased commands, temporarily switch into test mode, execute their tasks (e.g., Wi‚ÄëFi scans or simulations), and then reconnect to report results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

* üõ∞Ô∏è **Distributed Operation:** Multiple Agents performing tasks simultaneously under one Commander.
* üîê **Privacy Defense Tools:** Network activity simulations to test resilience against passive tracking or metadata collection.
* üåê **REST API Control:** Simple command‚Äëbased communication for easy mobile or desktop integration.
* üí§ **Power Efficiency:** Headless design with deep sleep support for extended field use.
* ‚ö° **Interoperability:** Seamless collaboration between ESP8266 and ESP32 devices ‚Äî no hardware modification required.
* üß© **Scalability:** Easily expand the system with new Agents for larger operations or experiments.

## üß≠ Concept in Action

### Control Flow Summary

1. **Commander App** creates a protected Wi‚ÄëFi network.
2. **Agents** connect and register themselves.
3. **Commander** sends REST commands for tasks (e.g., scanning or simulation).
4. **Agents** temporarily switch to analysis mode, perform the task, and store results.
5. **Agents** reconnect to report results and await new commands.

This architecture ensures high stability and avoids radio conflicts common in dual‚Äëmode setups.

## üîê Example Use Case ‚Äî Privacy Protection

Large retail centers often use Wi‚ÄëFi probe request tracking to analyze visitor behavior. Project Synapse can conceptually generate controlled ‚Äúnoise‚Äù to test and evaluate such systems, ensuring they cannot easily correlate user identities.

By simulating randomized probe activity, Synapse demonstrates how network privacy defenses can protect users against passive location tracking.

## üß© Advanced Concept Modes (Planned)

> **Note:** The following modes are for controlled research, simulation, or laboratory testing only. They are not active in the public firmware.

* **Deauthentication Simulation** ‚Äì Testing network resilience by simulating temporary disconnect waves.
* **Beacon & Probe Flood Simulation** ‚Äì Generating randomized SSID broadcast traffic for privacy stress‚Äëtests.
* **Snooping / Passive Capture** ‚Äì Capturing and analyzing nearby signals for research purposes.

All modes are disabled by default and require explicit activation in test environments with authorization.
